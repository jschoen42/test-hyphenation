german_words
============

A list of German words based on https://github.com/michmech/lemmatization-lists

The lemma/token pairs have been broken up, only words and partially their declined
or conjugated forms remain, seperated by line breaks.


Features
--------

Currently 422.494 words. These are not all different words, there are up to six (?)
variations of the same words, like their past tense, their gerunds, their plurals,
and so on (same for nouns).
The words I added to michmech's list are coming from the speeches of parlamentarians.
They cover a wide range of German society's topics, like education, economy, etc. as
seen through the eyes of politicians.
